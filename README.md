# HarvesterOpinion

## Overview
This tool assists agricultural experts in making informed harvesting decisions by classifying crop images through a user-friendly interface. Each image is presented with multiple classification options to determine the optimal harvesting time.

## Features
- **Interactive Classification**: Each crop image is displayed along with three specific options for harvesting decisions:
  1. **Cut Now**: Immediate harvesting is recommended.
  2. **Keep for Next Cut in 3 Weeks**: Delay harvesting for optimal growth.
  3. **Wait for More Than 3 Weeks**: Postpone harvesting for further assessment.
  
- **User Interface**: Utilizes radio buttons for selections, ensuring ease of use and clarity in classification.
- **Data Management**: Annotations are saved using a "Save" button and stored in a CSV file for record-keeping and further analysis.
- **Progress Tracking**: The GUI displays the number of images processed and updates this count as each new image is classified, providing users with clear progress indicators.
- **Completion Notification**: Once all images in the dataset are processed, the tool signals that the annotation task has been completed.
